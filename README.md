# Typing Smart Trainer
Typing Smart Trainer is a tool that is designed to help you improve your speed at typing code.
It allows you to add files for specific languages and repos that you can then practice typing.
After you complete each file it will give you your words per minute, your error rate percentage, and show you all of the places you made errors.
